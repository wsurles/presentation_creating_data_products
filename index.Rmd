## A D3 chart
```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
require(rCharts)
haireye = as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = 'Eye', type = 'multiBarChart',
  data = subset(haireye, Sex == 'Male')
)
n1
```

*** .hint
I used R not javascript/html/css

*** .explanation
```s

## Build a simple shiny App
![img](assets/img/histogram_example.png)

---
## ui.R
```{r ui, results = 'hide', tidy = F, message = F}
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Simple Histogram App"),
  sidebarPanel(
    selectInput(inputId = "n_breaks",
                label = "Number of bins",
                choices = c(10, 20, 25, 30, 50),
                selected = 20
                )
  ),
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput(outputId = "main_plot")
  )
))
```

---
## server.r
```{r server, results = 'hide', tidy = F, message = F}
shinyServer(function(input,output){

  output$main_plot <- renderPlot({  
    hist(faithful$eruptions,
         breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
         col = "green",
         xlab = "Duration (minutes)")  
  })
})
```


---
## Add Interactive Charts

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
require(rCharts)
haireye = as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = 'Eye', type = 'multiBarChart',
  data = subset(haireye, Sex == 'Male')
)
n1
```

---
## Add Interactive Charts

```{r ichart, results = 'hide', tidy = F, message = F}
require(rCharts)
haireye = as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, 
  group = 'Eye',
  data = subset(haireye, Sex == 'Male'),
  type = 'multiBarChart'
)
n1
```
